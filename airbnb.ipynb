    "\n",
    "A dataset containing information of accommodations published in AirBnB with their respective prices is presented. The size of the train dataset is approximately 1.5 Gb, and 0.5 Gb for the test dataset. This has 84 predictor variables that can be used as they see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to assign the correct price to the listed accommodations. \n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating the rental prices of accommodations listed on AirBnB. By leveraging a dataset consisting of various attributes and historical pricing data of listed accommodations, we aim to build a model that minimizes the error in price prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this endeavor will be evaluated based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, with the goal of achieving an MAE of less than 70 points (based on the [participation in Kaggle](##Participation-in-Kaggle-Competition)). This objective aligns with the criteria set forth in the associated Kaggle competition, which serves as a structured platform for benchmarking the performance of our model against others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tasks have been outlined to aid in the accomplishment of this objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conduct thorough [exploratory data analysis](###Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(EDA)) to understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the data.\n",
    "- [Preprocess the data](###Data-Preprocessing) to ensure it is well-suited for training machine learning models.\n",
    "- Establish a [baseline model](##Baseline-Model) using a feed-forward neural network architecture, against which further models and techniques can be compared.\n",
    "- Engage in a methodical [grid search](###Grid-Search-Setup) to identify the optimal hyperparameters for our model, utilizing tools such as [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) for systematic exploration and logging.\n",
    "- Incorporate advanced techniques including [Batch Normalization](###Batch-Normalization) and [Gradient Normalization/Clipping](###Gradient-Normalization-and/or-Gradient-Clipping) to enhance the learning process and stability of the model.\n",
    "- Continuously evaluate the performance of the model, iterating on the architecture and training process as necessary to inch closer to the desired MAE goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to a structured approach encompassing data exploration, preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced technique implementation, we aspire to develop a robust model that stands up to the competition standards and possibly exceeds them, thereby moving closer to solving the real-world problem of accurate price prediction in the peer-to-peer accommodation rental domain.\n"

    "4. **Minimum (min) and Maximum (max):** The smallest and largest values in each attribute, respectively.\n",

    "Data preprocessing is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline. It involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format that can be used to train machine learning models effectively. The objective is to create high-quality data that boosts the performance of models by reducing potential sources of error and bias. Here's an overview of the key steps involved in data preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Missing Values:**\n",
    "   - Identify and fill or drop missing values to ensure a complete dataset. Strategies may include mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, or utilizing algorithms that handle missing values like K-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encoding Categorical Variables:**\n",
    "   - Convert categorical variables into a numerical format through encoding techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or binary encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scaling and Normalization:**\n",
    "   - Standardize or normalize numerical variables to ensure that they are on a comparable scale. This is particularly important for algorithms sensitive to the scale of input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - For textual data, perform cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization to convert text into a format suitable for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Splitting:**\n",
    "   - Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the performance of models accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Outlier Detection:**\n",
    "    - Identify and handle outliers which can adversely affect model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps requires careful consideration and a good understanding of the data and the problem at hand. The preprocessing steps taken can significantly affect the outcome of the final models, and therefore, a well-thought-out preprocessing strategy is crucial for building robust and high-performing machine learning models.\n"
